My Robot is Disconnected!
=========================

This red circles means that it doesn't look like your Robot has established a connection to Beam yet. You need to do this before you're able to run playbooks.

Fortunately, we have a number of client libraries that you'll find useful to get started with:

- `Node.js <https://github.com/WatchBeam/beam-interactive-node>`_ (:doc:`tutorial <../tutorial>`)
- `Python <https://github.com/WatchBeam/beam-interactive-python>`_ (:doc:`reference <../python_api>`)
- `Java <https://github.com/WatchBeam/beam-interactive-java>`_ (`examples <https://github.com/WatchBeam/beam-interactive-java/tree/master/src/example/java/pro/beam/example>`_)


If you don't see your preferred language listed above or you want more details, you can go to our `developer site <https://developer.beam.pro/>`_ to view the API documentation, view the rest of the :doc:`Interactive documentation <../index>`, or head to our `Gitter room <https://gitter.im/MCProHosting/beam-dev>`_ for help.
